    <string name="location1history">Beit el Mtoni literally means The Palace by the stream. The palace owes this name to its beautiful location on the western shore of Zanzibar. It is one of the oldest buildings of Zanzibar and it was the largest palace on the island during the reign of Sultan Sayyid Said, who moved the capital of his Omani empire form Muscat to Zanzibar during the first half of the 19th century. At that time, over a thousand people lived in the palace and its direct surroundings. But around the 1880s the palace was abandoned and fell into ruin. Although severely deteriorated, Mtoni Palace still offers visitors a glimpse into the world of the Arabian royalty once living there. 
Entering the palace from the coast line, one steps into the former reception hall. Most guests would not go any further when visiting Beit el Mtoni, since the women in the palace were not to be seen by stranger’s eyes. But now, visitors can step over the threshold and walk in the footsteps of the Omani household. A visit continues into the inner courtyard, the palace garden and the well preserved bathing complex. One row of baths was used by the courtiers, whereas a separate domed aisle was uniquely reserved for the use of the Sultan and his first spouse.</string>

    <string name="location2history">A long sand beach, shallow waters and wind at almost any day of the year – this is a perfect spot for kite surfing! Top it up with wide selection of hotels of different price ranges and great diving opportunities. But no need to be a kite surfer to fully enjoy the east coast of Zanzibar. There are plenty of things to do in and around Paje. It’s a great base when you want to explore the island and nearby waters. Kizimkazi, village known for dolphins living near by, is just a short drive away. Jambiani village is a walking distance away, Jozani Forest on the way when you drive to Paje, and historical caves all around.</string>

    <string name="location3history">The Mangapwani Slave Chamber is ~20 kms north of Stone Town and 2 kms up the coast from the Mangapwani Coral Cavern.  The Slave Chamber is a square underground cell that was cut out of the coralline rock, with a roof on top.  The chamber was originally built by Mohammed bin Nassor Al-Alwi, a prosperous slave trader, to store his slaves.  Boats from Bagamoyo on the Tanzania mainland would unload their human cargo on a secluded beach, separated from the main Mangapwani Beach by coral-rock outcrops.  The dirt path from the beach to the Slave Chamber still exists today.
Mohammed bin Nassor would keep his slaves here until it was time to take them into Zanzibar Town for sale at the Slave Market.  Many historians believe that even after Sultan Barghash signed the Anglo–Zanzibari treaty which officially abolished the slave trade in 1873, the cave was still used as a place to hide slaves, as the slave trade continued illegally for many years.  </string>

    <string name="location4history">The Palace Museum is a large building with castellated battlements overlooking the Indian Ocean on Mizingani Road in Stone Town.  Originally called the Sultans Palace, it was built in the late 1890s for members of the sultans family and is the most recent of the Sultan’s palaces in Zanzibar.  In 1911 it became the official residence of the Sultan of Zanzibar.  After the 1964 Revolution, when Sultan Jamshid was overthrown, it was renamed the Peoples Palace and used as government offices.  In 1994 it became a museum dedicated to the history and lifestyle of the Sultans of Zanzibar.
Incredibly, a significant collection of the Sultans furniture and other possessions survived the revolution and can be seen by the public today.  The museum is well organised and informative with the ground floor dedicated to the early years of the sultanate (1828 to 1870), and the upper floors dedicated to the later more affluent period of 1870 to 1896. Some of the contents on display include thrones, paintings, family photographs, banqueting tables, ceremonial furniture, pieces of Princess Salme s personal wardrobe and even the sultan s personal water-closet.  
Of particular note is a room dedicated to the famous Princess Salme, daughter of Sultan Said, who eloped to Hamburg with a German merchant in 1866.  Renowned for her manuscript Memoirs of an Arabian Princess from Zanzibar, her autobiography is the only known written account of what life was like for Arab women of the Royal court in the 1800s.  Copies are available for sale inside the museum.
In the palace garden is Makusurani graveyard containing the graves of Sultans Said, Barghash, Majid, Khaled, Khalifa and Abdullah.</string>
